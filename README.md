# Neural Network based Song Structure Analysis

In this repository, you will find all the code that has been used for my fourth year project to date.

## Structure

The `client` directory contains all the code for the React webclient.

All the serverless code, including the custom layers, can be found in the `serverless` folder.

Custom Python code that was reused for the notebooks and the serverless functions is contained in the `src` folder. This code was installed with pip and the GitHub repo.

The data mining notebooks can be found in the `notebooks` directory, while the data is found in the `data` directory.

## Data
This repository does not contain any data. The Harmonix dataset can be found by visiting the [Harmonix GitHub repo](https://github.com/urinieto/harmonixset).
