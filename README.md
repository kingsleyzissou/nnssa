# Neural Network based Song Structure Analysis

In this repository, you will find all the code that has been used for my fourth year project to date.

The repository includes the dataset cleaning and pre-processing.

In addition to this, the repo contains a proof of concept neural network, that has been  
trained on a subset of 50 songs of the SALAMI dataset.
