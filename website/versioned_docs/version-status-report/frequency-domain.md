_A frequency domain representation of a kick drum hit, we can immediately see that fre- quency of the kick drum is very low_

The frequency-domain refers to the analysis of signals with respect to frequency rather than time. From figure 9, we can almost immediately deduce the fundamental frequency of the audio being relatively low just by looking at the graph. However, we lose information about the frequency over time.
