Boundary detection and song segmentation is a sub-field of music information retrieval. The aim of this project is to research and plan for the development of an artificial neural network that is able to detect the boundaries between song sections. On a subset of 50 songs of a music dataset, preliminary tests show that the proof of concept model is currently able to predict the song boundaries between songs with 28.99% accuracy. The full dataset is over 2,000 songs, almost double the size of the dataset used for the state-of-the-art algorithm.
