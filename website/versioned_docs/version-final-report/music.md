In music theory, a beat is a measure of time or pulse of a song or a recurring event. The number of beats in one minute gives us the tempo of a piece of music, also known as the beats per minute (BPM).

The even subdivisions of beats in a song are known as beats or measures. Typically in pop and electronic dance music, there are 4 beats in a bar, giving us what is known as 4|4 time. Another well known time signature is 3|4 time, used in the Waltz, and is made up of 3 beats per bar.
