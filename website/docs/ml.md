Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning aims at training computers to perform a task rather than programming them to achieve the tasks explicitly (Grabade, 2018). An example of this would be to give an algorithm data on temperatures in Celsius and corresponding temperatures in Fahrenheit and leave the model to figure out the relationship.
