_A spectrogram of a kick drum hit. The intensity of each frequency is indicated by the colour. In this case, we can see the fundamental frequency for the kick drum is quite low_

The time-frequency domain, in contrast to the time-domain, is a representation of the variation of an audio signal over time, rather than an average of the frequency over time (Kehtarnavaz, 2008).
