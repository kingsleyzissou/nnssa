Neural networks are made up of an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer and are designed to be an artificial simulation of the neurons of the human brain. At every layer there are a series of interconnected artificial neurons called nodes, with their own weights and biases. Data is passed via the nodes through each layer of the network at a time and multiple passes of the data are used to train the neural network. Deep neural networks are simply neural networks with more than 3 hidden layers (IBM Cloud Education, 2020).
