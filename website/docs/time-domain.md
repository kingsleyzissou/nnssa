_An audio waveform of a kick drum hit_

A time-domain representation of an audio signal displays the amplitude of a wave signal over time. Each additional frequency adds constructive and destructive wave interference. Therefore, an audio file with multiple frequencies for the same period of time will result in a complex wave form. From figures 7 and 8, it is not immediately clear what the fundamental frequency of each note is.
